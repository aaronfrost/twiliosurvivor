This is a starter project for the Twilio Survivor event. To get this code run the following from your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/aaronfrost/twiliosurvivor.git
```

Once you have cloned the repo, type:

```
cd twiliosurvivor
```

And then type:
```
npm install
```
This will install your all your dependencies. 

Now, to run the app you type:
```
node app.js
```

Now open your localhost:5001 in your browser. If your Twilio Account is configured correctly, you will see a landing page with your Twilio account info. If you get any errors, that means that you have a problem with your Twilio account.
